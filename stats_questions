| What is multicollinearity in regression analysis? Define it, provide an example, and explain how you would detect and handle it in a real-world scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, making it difficult to estimate their individual effect on the dependent variable. This can lead to unstable estimates and inflated standard errors.                                                                                                            |

| Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that uses L2 regularization to reduce the impact of multicollinearity and overfitting. It adds a penalty to the regression equation that discourages large coefficients, which helps to stabilize the model when independent variables are highly correlated.                                                                |

| Now explain the difference between Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression, focusing on how they handle coefficients and when you’d use each one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization, which adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function. Unlike Ridge Regression, which shrinks coefficients, Lasso can actually force some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.        |

| Elastic Net is a linear regression model that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It adds both the absolute value of the coefficients (Lasso) and the square of the coefficients (Ridge) to the loss function. Elastic Net is useful when you suspect high multicollinearity and also want feature selection.                                            |

| Definition: Bias refers to the error introduced by oversimplifying the model (underfitting). A model with high bias pays too little attention to the training data, making strong assumptions that lead to poor performance on both training and test sets.                                                                                                                  |

| Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets (training set), and testing it on the remaining subset (validation set). This process is repeated multiple times to ensure that the model's performance is consistent and not just due to the specific data split. |

| Suppose you’re working on a stock prediction project. You want to compare models like Ridge, Lasso, and AdaBoost. You could use 5-fold cross-validation to split the data, train each model on 4 folds, and test on the 5th fold, repeating this process for each model and fold. Afterward, you can compare their average performance using metrics like RMSE or R^2.       |

A higher AUC indicates better model performance.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Explain p-value in hypothesis testing.

| A low p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| In a medical trial testing a new drug, the null hypothesis might be that the drug has no effect. If you get a p-value of 0.02, it suggests that there's only a 2% chance of observing such strong evidence if the null hypothesis were true, leading you to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the drug is effective.                                                   |

| A 95% confidence interval means that if you were to take 100 different samples and compute a confidence interval for each, about 95 of them would contain the true population parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| If you calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height of people in a city as (5.6,5.9)(5.6, 5.9)(5.6,5.9) feet, it means that you are 95% confident that the true average height of the population falls between 5.6 and 5.9 feet.                                                                                                                               |

| The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean (or sum) will approach a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the original population distribution.                                                                                                                                                  |

| If you are studying the average height of people in a city, and the population distribution of heights is skewed, as long as you take a sufficiently large sample, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal.                                                                                                                                        |

| What is heteroscedasticity, and why is it a problem in regression analysis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Heteroscedasticity refers to the situation in regression analysis where the variability of the errors (residuals) is not constant across all levels of an independent variable. This violates one of the key assumptions of linear regression, which assumes homoscedasticity—that the residuals should have constant variance.                                              |

| When heteroscedasticity is present, it can lead to inefficient estimates and biased standard errors, which in turn affects hypothesis testing (e.g., p-values can be misleading).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| In practice, it means the model might give too much weight to some data points and too little to others, leading to unreliable predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Purpose: Tests whether the residual variance from a regression model depends on the values of the independent variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Procedure: Regress the squared residuals from the original regression on the independent variables. If the test statistic is significant, it suggests heteroscedasticity is present.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Purpose: A more general test for heteroscedasticity that doesn’t require the relationship between residual variance and independent variables to be linear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals (errors) from one observation are correlated with the residuals from another. This violates one of the assumptions of linear regression, which assumes that the residuals are independent.                                                                                                                                         |

| Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of independent variables in the model. It adjusts the R-squared value by penalizing for adding unnecessary predictors that don’t improve the model's fit.                                                                                                                                 |

| While R-squared always increases (or stays the same) when you add more predictors to the model, Adjusted R-squared will increase only if the new predictor improves the model.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| If a predictor doesn't improve the model, Adjusted R-squared can decrease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| When XTX\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}XTX is not invertible (singular or non-square), the pseudoinverse is used to compute a solution. The pseudoinverse X+\\mathbf{X}^+X+ allows us to still solve for β\\betaβ when the matrix is singular.                                                                                                                                     |

| Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the original features into a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. These components capture the most variance in the data.                                                                                    |

| The first principal component captures the maximum variance in the data, followed by the second, and so on. Each component is orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the others.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| L1 (Lasso) is better for feature elimination, as it can set some coefficients to zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| L2 (Ridge) helps to reduce overfitting by shrinking coefficients, but it does not remove features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is a metric used to assess the quality of a statistical model for a given set of data. It helps in model selection by balancing the tradeoff between goodness of fit and model complexity.                                                                                                                                                |

| Lower AIC values are better because they indicate a model that fits well without being overly complex. However, it should not be interpreted in isolation but rather compared across models.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will approach the population mean (or parameter). This is fundamental in statistics because it guarantees that estimates based on large samples are likely to be close to the true population values.                                                                               |

| Stock prices often show trends over time, making them non-stationary. To make them stationary, you might look at daily returns instead of the actual prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Pseudoreplication occurs when multiple measurements or samples are taken from the same experimental unit and treated as independent, which artificially inflates the sample size and can lead to incorrect conclusions.                                                                                                                                                      |

Avoiding the curse of dimensionality: As the number of dimensions (features) increases, the data becomes sparse, and models can struggle to generalize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| The Bonferroni correction is a method used to address the problem of multiple comparisons in statistical tests. When multiple hypothesis tests are conducted, the chance of making a Type I error (false positive) increases. The Bonferroni correction helps to control this by adjusting the significance level.                                                           |

| It creates spurious relationships where you might think the independent variable is causing an effect when, in fact, the confounder is driving the relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| In a study examining the relationship between ice cream sales and drowning incidents, the temperature (a confounding variable) affects both. On hot days, more people buy ice cream and more people swim, increasing the chance of drowning. Without considering temperature, one might falsely conclude that ice cream sales cause drowning.                                |

| Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It updates the probability estimate for an event as more evidence or information becomes available.                                                                                                                                          |

| The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of false positives (incorrectly rejected null hypotheses) among all the rejected hypotheses in multiple testing scenarios. It helps control for the rate at which false discoveries are made when conducting many tests simultaneously.                                                                            |

| Data imputation is the process of filling in missing values in a dataset. Missing data can skew analysis and reduce model accuracy, so handling them properly is crucial.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate the distribution of a statistic (e.g., mean, median) by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data. It helps estimate confidence intervals, standard errors, and model accuracy when traditional assumptions (like normality) don’t hold.                                                          |

| Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms used to sample from complex probability distributions where traditional sampling methods are inefficient. It’s widely used in Bayesian statistics to estimate the posterior distribution when it is difficult to calculate directly.                                                                                |

| 1\. Markov Chain: A sequence of random variables where the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state (not on previous states).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| MCMC helps approximate the posterior distribution when it cannot be computed analytically. Instead of directly solving for the posterior, MCMC generates a large number of samples from the distribution using iterative steps.                                                                                                                                              |

It works by breaking down the complex joint distribution into a series of conditional distributions.                                                                                                    |

| 1\. Start with an Initial Guess: Choose an initial value for each variable in the distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2\. Update One Variable at a Time: For each variable, update its value by sampling from its conditional distribution, keeping the other variables fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 3\. Iterate: Repeat the process until convergence, i.e., when the distribution of samples stabilizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Question: What is stationarity in time series, and why is it important?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Answer: A time series is said to be stationary if its mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure do not change over time. It’s important because many time series models (like ARIMA) require data to be stationary to make reliable predictions.                                                                                                                         |
| Real-life Scenario: In financial forecasting, a stationary series ensures that the volatility of stock prices doesn’t fluctuate unpredictably, which helps in building accurate investment models.                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Answer: A Kaplan-Meier curve estimates the survival probability over time using step functions. It is useful for visualizing survival data and comparing survival rates between different groups.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Real-life Scenario: In a clinical trial, Kaplan-Meier curves can show the survival rates of patients receiving a new drug vs. a placebo, aiding in assessing drug efficacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Question: What is censoring in survival analysis?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Answer: Censoring occurs when the exact event time is not observed. For example, if a study ends before an event occurs or a participant drops out, the data is right-censored.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Real-life Scenario: In customer churn analysis, censoring happens if customers haven’t churned yet by the end of the study. Proper handling ensures unbiased churn predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Answer: An RCT is a study design where participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. Randomization reduces bias and ensures that differences in outcomes are due to the treatment.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Real-life Scenario: In drug testing, patients are randomly assigned to receive either a new medication or a placebo.

It is used when subgroups are expected to differ significantly, ensuring representation.                                                                                                                                             |
| Real-life Scenario: In political surveys, stratified sampling ensures that different demographic groups (e.g., age, income) are proportionately represented in the sample.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Answer: In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. All or a random sample of members from chosen clusters are then surveyed.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Real-life Scenario: In education research, schools within a district can be treated as clusters, and only a few schools are chosen for the study, saving time and resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Answer: Quantile regression models the conditional quantiles of the response variable, rather than the mean. It is used when heteroscedasticity exists, or when we’re interested in modeling the median or other quantiles.                                                                                                                                                  |

Question: What is the Mann-Whitney U test?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Answer: The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test used to compare two independent groups when the assumption of normality is not met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Real-life Scenario: In consumer satisfaction surveys, Mann-Whitney can compare satisfaction scores between two cities without assuming a normal distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
