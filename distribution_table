| Distribution Name        | Use of the Distribution                                                 | Real-Life Scenarios                                                           | Shape (Layman Terms) | Tests                                    | Why We Do the Test                                                                        |

| Normal Distribution      | Used in many natural phenomena (e.g., heights, test scores).            | Heights of people, IQ scores, standardized test results                       | Bell-shaped          | Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, K-S test | To verify if the data follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution.                           |
| Uniform Distribution     | Used to model equal probabilities (e.g., rolling a fair die).           | Rolling a die, selecting a random number                                      | Flat                 | Chi-Square Goodness of Fit, K-S test     | To check if data is equally spread across the range (flat).                               |
| Binomial Distribution    | Used in binary outcomes (e.g., success/failure in trials).              | Flipping a coin, quality control (defective/not defective)                    | Spiked               | Chi-Square Goodness of Fit               | To confirm if the number of successes in trials fits binomial outcomes.                   |
| Poisson Distribution     | Used to model rare events over a fixed interval (e.g., call arrivals).  | Number of customer arrivals in a store, traffic accidents                     | Skewed-right         | Chi-Square Goodness of Fit, K-S test     | To test if events occur at a constant rate in a fixed interval.                           |
| Exponential Distribution | Used for modeling time between events (e.g., time between phone calls). | Time between arrivals in a queue, lifespan of devices                         | Decaying             | K-S test, Anderson-Darling               | To check if the time between events is exponentially distributed.                         |
| Log-normal Distribution  | Used in wealth distribution or stock prices (right-skewed data).        | Stock prices, income distribution                                             | Right-skewed         | Shapiro-Wilk, K-S test                   | To verify if data follows a log-normal distribution (skewed).                             |
| Beta Distribution        | Used for probabilities (e.g., modeling proportions like success rates). | A/B testing, predicting batting average in sports                             | Variable             | K-S test, Anderson-Darling               | To test if data follows the Beta distribution over a defined range.                       |
| Gamma Distribution       | Used to model waiting times (e.g., life expectancy, insurance risk).    | Life expectancy, failure rates of machines                                    | Humped-right         | K-S test, Anderson-Darling               | To check if the data follows the gamma distribution, often in lifetimes or waiting times. |
| Chi-Square Distribution  | Used for variance testing and hypothesis testing in statistics.         | Test for independence in contingency tables, genetic research                 | Right-skewed         | K-S test, Anderson-Darling               | To test if data follows the Chi-square distribution, common in variance testing.          |
| Multimodal Distribution  | Used to identify multiple patterns or processes in data.                | Heights of people in mixed populations (children/adults), market segmentation | Multiple-peaks       | None specific, but KDE for visual checks | To identify multiple modes (peaks) in the data distribution.                              |
| Bernoulli Distribution   | Used for binary (yes/no) outcomes, like coin tosses.                    | Passing/failing a test, winning/losing in a game                              | Two-bar              | Chi-Square Goodness of Fit               | To test if a binary outcome fits the Bernoulli distribution (success/failure).            |
